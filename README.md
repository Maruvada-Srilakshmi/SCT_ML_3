# Cat and Dog classification using CNN
A cat and dog classifier using CNN is a deep learning project that employs convolutional neural networks to automatically distinguish images of cats and dogs. The CNN model is trained on labeled images, learning to extract features and patterns unique to each animal category, then predicts whether new images represent a cat or a dog.

## Key Components
Dataset: The most common datasets for such projects contain thousands of labeled cat and dog images, such as the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

Model Architecture: 

The CNN typically includes:

1)Input layer for image data

2)Multiple convolutional layers to extract features (edges, shapes, textures)

3)Pooling layers for downsampling and feature consolidation

4)Flattening and fully connected (dense) layers for prediction

Training Process: The model is trained through batch processing, comparing predictions with true labels and updating weights to minimize classification error.

Outcome: The final trained model can generalize and classify new images with high accuracy, serving as a foundation for understanding image classification tasks in deep learning

## Project Features
Automatic feature extraction from raw images.

Capability to test model performance with user-supplied images.

Extendable to other animal or object classifiers by re-training with different datasets.

Demonstrates practical use cases of deep learning and CNNs in pattern recognition.
